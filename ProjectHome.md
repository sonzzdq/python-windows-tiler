A small simple tiler for Windows written in Python, using the pywin32 modules.

NEW VERSION 1.0 is out now, it introduces a config file which should be pretty self explanatory. It allows you to configure your hotkeys and set basic window rules based on the window's classname.

Please file any issues you have in the issues tracker with the corresponding error and errors.log(found in the directory PWT is running from)

Featuring:

> Tiling window management

> Workspaces

> Per monitor tiling

> Low use of resources

> Ergonomic VI-based hotkeys
